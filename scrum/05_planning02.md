# Planning 02

The complete `Agile Team` has a meeting after the first `Revision` of the work in progress.

There is dialogue about:

- Unfulfilled tasks and their reasons.
- Tasks not done at all and their reasons (the `Scrum Master` insist on them).
- Issues related to performance, especially loading speed.
- A few low priority front-end details.
- Necessary changes in order to speed up the project.
