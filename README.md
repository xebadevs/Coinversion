## A SCRUM Framework Simulation

### Context

Mr. Clamberhans, from now on `The Client`, met with the `Product Owner` (PO) of the `Agile Team` at *XebaDevs Company*.

`The client` wants a website to be developed that solves a specific need, related with their investments.

He's a grown man who currently resides in Argentina but perform transactions in South American Pesos, Reais, Dollars, Pounds Sterling and Euros. Recently, he has turned a minor part of his capital in cryptocurrencies.

Since it is not very tech-friendly, and his oldest son is in charge of lead his investments, he wants to at least be up to date with the latest coin rates and more relevant news from the trading market.

`The client` want all these in just one single page: quick and easy.

For the `PO` it is a reasonable request, so he accepts it. Soon he meets with the `Scrum Master` (SM) of the `Agile Team` to start the project creating the `Product Backlog`.

## SCRUM Documentation

You could find the complete SCRUM Documentation in the following link:

> https://github.com/xebadevs/Coinversion/tree/master/scrum

It's extensive to be included in this section.

Comprehend: `Design mockup`, `QA's reports`, `Travel Log`, `Product Backlog`, `Plannings`, `Sprints` and `Revisions`.

## Justification

This methodology is one of the most used in technology development.

It seemed relevant to me to be able to diagram a project from it, fulfilling the different roles and leaving a written record about it.

I have to admit that it was really useful at the time to organize and materialize this project.

## Build With

- `PHP 7+`.
- `Bulma` as CSS Framework.

Extra Tools:
- `Figma` for mockup's design.
- `Photoshop` for the portfolio images edition.

<br>



## Technical Comments

First portfolio project with a back-end side.

Use of `APIs` and `Web Scrapping`.

An incessant search for the best methods in these tools to achieve the best `Performance`.

The Business & Financial New's API allows only 100 calls per day. After that returns *Lorem Ipsum* text.

<br>




## Local Use

I recommend to use `XAMPP` (Windows / MacOS) or `LAMP` (Linux) as an Apache distribution to host a server locally.

Download the project o merge it in `htdocs` folder inside the installation path of your **XAMPP** / **LAMP**.
