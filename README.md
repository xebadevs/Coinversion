## A SCRUM Framework Simulation

### First Stage

Mr. Clamberhans, from now on `The Client`, met with the `Product Owner` (PO) of the `Agile Team` at *XebaDevs Company*.

`The client` wants a website to be developed that solves a specific need, related with their investments.

He's a grown man who currently resides in Argentina but perform transactions in South American Pesos, Reais, Dollars and Euros. Recently, he has turned a minor part of his capital in cryptocurrencies.

Since it is not very tech-friendly, and his oldest son is in charge of lead his investments, he wants to at least be up to date with the latest coin rates and more relevant news from the trading market.

`The client` want all these in just one single page: quick and easy.

For the `PO` it is a reasonable request, so he accepts it. Soon he meets with the `Scrum Master` (SM) of the `Agile Team` to start the project creating the `Product Backlog`.
